# StringPacks

StringPacks is a library to store translation strings in a more efficient binary format for Android applications, so that it reduces the Android APK size.

Check out [our tech talk on StringPacks from DroidCon SF 2019](https://youtu.be/npnamYPQD3g?t=812) to know more about the motivation, architecture and prospect of the StringPacks project.

## Requirements

- **Python 3** - The StringPacks python scripts are written in Python 3.
- **minSdkVersion 15** - The library default min sdk version is 15, but it should work for lower SDK versions.
- **Git** - The script uses `git ls-files` to look up files.
- **Android development environment**
- **Gradle Build System**


## Setup in Android Project

1. Copy the [scripts/](library/scripts/) and [pack.gradle](library/pack.gradle) from `library/` to the root directory of your Android project.
2. Move either [Java](library/templates/StringPackIds.java) or [Kotlin](library/templates/StringPackIds.kt) version of `StringPackIds` file from [templates/](library/templates/) directory to your project source code directory.
    - Edit package information of the file.
3. Move [template config.json](library/templates/config.json) to your Android application project directory.
    - Replace `{app}` to be your application project directory name.
    - Point `pack_ids_class_file_path` to the path where you put the `StringPackIds` file.
4. Make following changes to your Android project's `build.gradle`.
   ```
   allprojects {

     repositories {
       ...
       mavenCentral()
    }
    ...
   }

   // Replace `{path_to_config.json}` with the path to your `config.json` file
   ext {
     stringPacksConfigFile = "$rootDir/{path_to_config.json}"
   }
   ```
   - Replace `{path_to_config.json}` with the path to your `config.json` file
5. Make following changes to your Android application's `build.gradle`
   ```
   apply from: "$rootDir/pack.gradle"

   dependencies {
     ...
     ...
     implementation 'com.whatsapp.stringpacks:stringpacks:0.3.1'
   }
   ```
6. To remove old `.pack` files from the device's internal storage, on every app upgrade, add [MyPackageReplacedReceiver.java](library/src/main/java/com/whatsapp/stringpacks/receiver/MyPackageReplacedReceiver.java) and [PackFileDeletionService.java](library/src/main/java/com/whatsapp/stringpacks/service/PackFileDeletionService.java) to your `AndroidManifest.xml`
    ```
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK"/>
    <application ...>
      ...
      <receiver android:name="com.whatsapp.stringpacks.receiver.MyPackageReplacedReceiver">
        <intent-filter>
            <action android:name="android.intent.action.MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED" />
        </intent-filter>
      </receiver>
      <service android:name="com.whatsapp.stringpacks.service.PackFileDeletionService" android:permission="android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE" />
    </application>
    ```
> Note: If you want to delete old `.pack` files, from internal storage, at some other time instead of app upgrade, call `StringPacks.cleanupOldPackFiles(getApplicationContext())` whenever you want. You don't have to include [MyPackageReplacedReceiver.java](library/src/main/java/com/whatsapp/stringpacks/receiver/MyPackageReplacedReceiver.java) or [PackFileDeletionService.java](library/src/main/java/com/whatsapp/stringpacks/service/PackFileDeletionService.java) in your `AndroidManifest.xml`

You now have StringPacks available in your Android project.

## Getting Started

There are a few steps to walk through before you can really use packed strings in your application. But don't worry, most of them only need to be done once.

### Runtime

Since the translated strings are moved to our special binary format (`.pack` files), your application needs a way to read those strings during runtime. The library provides a wrapper class for [`Context`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContextWrapper) and [`Resources`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Resources) to help with that.

You need to add the following code to all subclasses of your Context class (like [`Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) and [`Service`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service)) to ensure the strings are read from `.pack` files instead of Android system resources.

```java
// Java

@Override
protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
    super.attachBaseContext(StringPackContext.wrap(base));
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin

override fun attachBaseContext(base: Context?) {
    super.attachBaseContext(StringPackContext.wrap(base))
}
```

If all of the following conditions meet, you need to override `getResources()` function also in your `Activity`
1. App's `minSdkVersion` is < 17
2. You have a dependency on `androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.2.0`
3. Your Activity extends from [`AppCompatActivity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/appcompat/app/AppCompatActivity)

```java
// Java

private @Nullable StringPackResources stringPackResources;
@Override
public Resources getResources() {
  if (stringPackResources == null) {
    stringPackResources = StringPackResources.wrap(super.getResources());
  }
  return stringPackResources;
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin

private @Nullable var stringPackResources:Resources? = null
override fun getResources(): Resources? {
  if (stringPackResources == null) {
    stringPackResources = StringPackResources.wrap(super.getResources())
  }
  return stringPackResources
}
```

Your Android application also needs to use a custom [`Application`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application), which needs to include the following code to ensure the strings are read from `.pack` files.

```java
// Java

@Override
protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
  StringPackIds.registerStringPackIds();
  StringPacks.getInstance().setUp(base);

  super.attachBaseContext(base);
}

private @Nullable StringPackResources stringPackResources;
@Override
public Resources getResources() {
  if (stringPackResources == null) {
    stringPackResources = StringPackResources.wrap(super.getResources());
  }
  return stringPackResources;
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin

override fun attachBaseContext(base: Context?) {
    registerStringPackIds()
    StringPacks.getInstance().setUp(base)

    super.attachBaseContext(base)
}

private @Nullable var stringPackResources:Resources? = null
override fun getResources(): Resources? {
  if (stringPackResources == null) {
    stringPackResources = StringPackResources.wrap(super.getResources())
  }
  return stringPackResources
}
```

You only need to do this each time you add a new context component. You don't need to do this for each component if you add them to a base class.

### Region specific locales & Fallback

You can map multiple regions into a single `.pack` file using `pack_id_mapping` in [config.json](library/templates/config.json). For example

```json
pack_id_mapping = {
  "es-rMX": "es",
  "es-rES": "es"
}
```

Here, translations in `"es"`, `"es-MX"` and `"es-ES"` locales would be packed into `strings_es.pack` file.

If you are supporting any of the following features, you need to implement [StringPacksLocaleMetaDataProvider.java](library/src/main/java/com/whatsapp/stringpacks/StringPacksLocaleMetaDataProvider.java) and register the provider in your custom `Application` class
1. Packing translations for multiple locales (for example, `es-MX`, `es`) in to one `.pack` file, or
2. Fallback feature, or
3. Supporting region specific locales

```java
// Java

@Nullable private final StringPacksLocaleMetaDataProvider metaData = new LocaleMetaDataProviderImpl();
@Override
protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
  StringPackIds.registerStringPackIds();
  StringPacks.registerStringPackLocaleMetaData(metaData);
  StringPacks.getInstance().setUp(base);

  super.attachBaseContext(base);
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin

private @Nullable var metaData:StringPacksLocaleMetaDataProvider? = LocaleMetaDataProviderImpl()
override fun attachBaseContext(base: Context?) {
  registerStringPackIds();
  StringPacks.registerStringPackLocaleMetaData(metaData);
  StringPacks.getInstance().setUp(base);

  super.attachBaseContext(base);
}
```

Take a look at [LocaleMetaDataProviderImpl.java](sample/app/src/main/java/com/whatsapp/stringpacks/sample/LocaleMetaDataProviderImpl.java)  in the sample app for reference.

### Generate `.pack` files

You have added the `StringPackIds` file to your project, but it has nothing in it yet. It is supposed to hold the mapping from android resource IDs (`R.string`) to string pack IDs.
The content would be automatically filled in when you run the script that provided by this library.
The mapping information would also be used for generating the `.pack` files, so they are correctly loaded at runtime.

Execute the python script from your project root directory to assemble the string packs:
```bash
python3 ./scripts/assemble_string_packs.py --config ./{path_to}/config.json
```

You will see:

- The `StringPackIds` file has been updated with the pack ID mapping information;
- The translation strings, which are packable, have been moved to different directory, so that they won't be compiled into the APK;
- The `.pack` file for different language have been generated under the project assets/ directory.

When you update translations, or change a string in the project, you may run the script again to generate `.pack` files with latest content.

Those string resource IDs that are not listed in the `StringPackIds` file, will continue to be kept in the Android system resources, and the StringPacks runtime would automatically fall back to read from there.

&nbsp;

Now, you can use gradle to build your application as usual. The application should correctly retrieve the strings from StringPacks.
